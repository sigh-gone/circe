todo:
grab move keep connections:
 - keep all non-selected vertices, except 1 in contact with selected if non-essential
 - keep all selected vertices after transform
 - every selected vertex (A) that is connected to a non-selected vertex (B) is a connection to be routed
 - delete edges between A-B
 - run pathfinding from A to Net(B) (multiple goals per start)

- schematic: 
    ctrl-(shift)-z undo/redo - all commands need to have undo/redo - command trait? what counts as a command?

- designer:
    line segment edit - drag/drop end points
    device saving/loading, device libraries

- circuit:
    - nets/connections:
        connect devices with wire if ports overlap - just add port locations to graph - vertices without neighbors are floating nets - should play well with grab/drag
        wire snapping to ports and visual indicator
        custom net labels
        net highlighting
        pathfinding:
            inconsistent paths - lower priority
            regression tests
            grabbing (moves devices/wire while keeping wire connections)
    draw nets above symbol but below ports
    circuit add device submenu - d to bring up menu, r/v/g to place respective device
    improved parameters editor
    gui toolbar
    consider adding layers trait (devices layer, nets layer, etc.)

- immediate: 
    zooming during device placement visual bug - maybe selection system not a good fit, or just flag phantom devices to not draw?
    
    clean up colors, use iced theme?

- medium term:
    build script to copy ngspice.dll into directory

    logging

    use pane_grid from iced
    
    schematic saving/loading (serde)

    schematic checking - mark floating nets, ports

- long term:
    bypass iced, tesellate with lyon directly
    drawing/stroke culling (maybe?)

    additive/subtractive selection - waiting on better modifiers support
